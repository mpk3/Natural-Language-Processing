# Fake News
The explosion of data in the last 20 years has many interesting implications. One of the more insidious effects is the leveraging of Natural Language Processing and social media for political campaigns. Currently U.S. law allows companies/individuals to pay ad companies to create fake _grassroots_ organizations in order to sway political opinion. During the COVID-19 pandemic astroturfing is/was being used to create protests in major cities throughout the U.S. This was also seen during the 2016 presidential campaign with interference from Russia. In order to combat these efforts it is important to track and monitor the spread of disinformation on social media platforms such as twitter. This package is designed for just that. The Fake News package is designed to help track disinformation on twitter using natural language processing and statistical modeling.
