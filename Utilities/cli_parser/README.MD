# Command Line Parser
- Often at work or while working on other projects I need to parse random sentences to get a feel for what types of linguistic phenomenon are going on 
- Despite being a linguist I often find myself second-guessing my judgements
- This commandline script offers two functions that help to alleviate this problem.

```cli
parse.py -h
usage: parse.py [-h] [-c] [-d]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit\n
  -c, --cli      Command line string parser; 'quit' to exit; 'display' for
                 dependency graph
  -d, --display  Display dependency graph; 'C-c C-c' to exit
```
