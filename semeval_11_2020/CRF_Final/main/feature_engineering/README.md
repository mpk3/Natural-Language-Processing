### Feature Engineering:
Both of tagger.py and add_features.py were used to create and label data to be used in the CRF. tagger.py was originally used to create the data, while add\_features.py was used to update things as I tested different combinations of features. If you currently run add\_features.py, it will create the dataset for test phase 3 in the ../labeled\_data/new directory. I provided the exact same dataset in ../labeled\_/trial10. tagger.py currently creates a deprecated form of a trigram dataset I originally used when exploring CRF parameters.
