# Conditional Random Field
crf.py is the conditional random field implementation. It is set right now to go through all the results of test phase 3. If you run the file it will go through each of the tests in phase 3 and output the results to the screen. 

It obviously requires that you have all the dependencies installed.

iPython:
> run crf.py

Commandline:
> python3 crf.py
